      <p style="text-align: left;">MOAB Adventure is a side-scrolling aerial shooter game, written in JavaScript.  
        It takes the same concept as games like Rovio's <i>Bad Piggies</i>: What if you played as the original game's enemy?  
        <br>You, as the Bloons, must maneuver a blimp through an onslaught of boxes, dodging them until you can afford a weapon. Then, it's your job to survive, shooting boxes to gain extra money with which to buy upgrades, which allow you to keep up with the ever-increasing health pools of the boxes, strategising with damage types to destroy different kinds of boxes, until eventually reaching a boss. After that, all bets are off, as you can no longer simply dodge the boss - various attacks force you to move around, evading the attacks and gunning the boss down.  
        <br>This eventually allows you to progress to the next zone, where you do it all again, but with a twist: each zone has different boxes, bosses and even natural hazards to look out for, ending with an extremely powerful final boss for the zone.  
        <br>A selection of difficulties, gamemodes and weapon options allow for many runs through the game, each with differing strategies.  </p>
