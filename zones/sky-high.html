      <h2>Overview</h2>
      <p><b>Sky High</b> is the first zone in MOAB Adventure. The player will spawn in here once all options have been
        chosen, and will begin playing the game.</p>
      <h2>Appearance</h2>
      <p>Sky High is a zone that takes place above an ocean with dark blue water. Islands and clouds are supposed to
        render, but they don't show up in-game.</p>
      <h2>Spawning</h2>
      <p><a href="../boxes/wood-box.html">Wooden boxes</a>, as the basic enemy of MOAB Adventure, spawn frequently
        here.<br>
        <a href="../boxes/metal-box.html">Metal boxes</a> spawn here too, at about 1/4 of the rate.
      </p>
      <h2>Strategy</h2>
      <p>The main enemy, <b>wooden boxes</b>, are quite weak, so most strategies will work
        against them. They appear in large amounts, so it's mostly best to employ <b>multi-target weaponry</b>, such as
        <a href="../weapons/bomb-shooter.html">Bomb Shooter</a> to clear the crowds.<br><br>As for the <b>metal
          boxes</b>, single-target methods are more effective, as they are more spaced out.
      </p>
