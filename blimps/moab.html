      <h2>Overview</h2>
      <p>The <b>MOAB</b> is the player's first character, unlocked for free at the start of the game. It has average
        stats, and suffices for most early-game operations.</p>
      <h2>Appearance</h2>
      <p>The MOAB is a light blue blimp, with a pear-shaped body with thin stripes running down the full length of the
        blimp, and perpendiculat white stripes around the nose and tail ends. The back end of the blimp has 4 light blue
        fins, but no visible means of propulsion.</p>
      <h2>Weapons</h2>
      <p>The MOAB has only one weapon slot: AP1, which can (at the time of writing) be upgraded to tier 3.</p>
      <h2>Use Cases</h2>
      <p>As this is the blimp you spawn with, it will be used throughout most of the early-game. It can carry the player
        through most of the first zone, but an upgrade is preferable for later levels as stronger boxes and harder
        bosses appear.
