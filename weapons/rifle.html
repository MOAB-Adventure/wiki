      <h2>Overview</h2>
      <p><b>Rifle</b> is the third weapon in the AP5 upgrade tree, coming after <a href="./double-shooter.html">Double
          Shooter</a>. It is one of the 4 weapons in the <i>first specialisation tier</i>, and is the cheapest tier 3 weapon.</p>
      <h2>Appearance</h2>
      <p>Double Shooter has a similar appearance to <b>Tiny Shooter</b>, also taking the form of a gun, but with an
        additional barrel, placed alongside the first, which has been shifted sideways to accommodate this.<br>Both
        barrels recoil at once when fired, as both bullets are fired simultaneously.</p>
      <h2>Attack Description</h2>
      <p>Rifle reverses the change made by Double Shooter, once more firing a single bullet. However, this bullet
        functions as two, as it is able to pierce a single box, and deal an additional one damage. The combined bullet
        is visually longer, and moves much faster. This gives the weapon increased range, as the bullet will travel
        further before 'hitting the ground' (despawning).</p>
      <h2>Use Cases</h2>
      <p>Rifle is a useful upgrade, especially for how cheap it is, removing the long-range problem that <b>Double
        Shooter</b> had, and instead pushing towards that aspect. The increased bullet speed makes hitting smaller
        targets easier, and the equivalent damage to a single target makes this a very good long-range option.<br>The
        piercing shot allows the weapon to hit 2 boxes in one shot, but only if they are lined up. This restricts the
        multi-target capabilities, but the bullet's pierce does not slow it down, meaning it can perform longer-range
        multi-target attacks than <a href="./bomb-shooter.html">Bomb Shooter</a>, whilst having the same single-target
        damage.</p>
