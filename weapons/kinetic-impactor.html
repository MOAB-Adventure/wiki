      <h2>Overview</h2>
      <p><b>Kinetic Impactor</b> is the fourth weapon in the AP2.1 upgrade tree, coming after <a
          href="./heavy-shots.html">Heavy Shots</a>. It is one of the 8 weapons in the <i>second specialisation
          tier</i>. It expands directly on the knockback utility of its predecessor, having almost identical use cases.
      </p>
      <h2>Appearance</h2>
      <p>Kinetic Impactor's appearance changes significantly from Heavy Shots, with 4 of the supports extending and
        ending with square 'feet'.<br>The central part gains a three-pronged design, and an extra support holds the
        barrel.</p>
      <h2>Attack Description</h2>
      <p>Kinetic Impactor adds a unique ability to knock boxes into each other, with knockback propagating with 75%
        efficiency. This does not depend on knockback left, but instead resets to 75% of the <i>full amount</i>,
        allowing a spaced chain of boxes to transfer knockback extreme distances.<br>THe base knockback is also doubled,
        increasing the defensive capability of this weapon.</p>
      <h2>Use Cases</h2>
      <p>Kinetic Impactor, as a weapon, is fairly useless, with the lowest damage of any T4, but has the ability to
        knock any box out of the player's hitbox with a single shot, unless blocked. This makes it effective defense
        against strong, spaced boxes, but the decreasing knockback makes it perform poorly against large groups.</p>
