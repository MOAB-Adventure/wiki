      <h2>Overview</h2>
      <p><b>Tiny Shooter</b> is a basic weapon, the first one unlocked in any playthrough.<br>Tiny Shooter's DPS is the
        lowest in the game, as is expected from the cheapest weapon. It is also the smallest weapon visually.</p>
      <h2>Appearance</h2>
      <p>Tiny Shooter takes the appearance of a small gun. The main body of the gun is a square, with a short barrel
        protruding
        from it. 2 support pieces can also be seen on the sides.</p>
      <h2>Attack Description</h2>
      <p>Tiny Shooter has a simple attack pattern, firing a bullet directly in front of it, generally at the mouse
        cursor. This bullet travels in a straight line, until it hits a target or drops to the ground. It deals 1
        <i>ballistic</i> damage to the first hit target. Tiny Shooter is a fairly fast-firing weapon, shooting every 20
        frames (~.33s).
      </p>
      <h2>Use Cases</h2>
      <p>Tiny Shooter, as the first weapon, must be bought before any further upgrades.<br>Due to its very low DPS, it
        is not a good option for enemy destruction, therefore should be upgraded as soon as possible.</p>
