      <h2>Overview</h2>
      <p><b>Missile Launcher</b> is the fourth weapon in the AP1.2 upgrade tree, coming after <a
          href="./double-shooter.html">Bomb Shooter</a>. It is one of the 8 weapons in the <i>second specialisation
          tier</i>. It introduces homing mechanics to players.</p>
      <h2>Appearance</h2>
      <p>Missile Launcher does away with the long barrel entirely, and the side plates curve towards the back of the
        weapon. The vertical plate on the back remains unchanged. The side plates are also further extended, on extra
        connecting poles.</p>
      <h2>Attack Description</h2>
      <p>Missile Launcher's shots move slightly faster, and are the first instance of homing bullets encountered in the
        game. The missiles home in on the closest box to the mouse pointer, helping the player aim. It also shoots
        slightly faster, and deals greatly increased damage, but in a smaller area than its predecessor.</p>
      <h2>Use Cases</h2>
      <p>Missile Launcher's homing ability allows the player to target boxes that would otherwise be unreachable, such
        as boxes behind others, and also helps in targeting faster boxes. This makes the weapon well-suited to use on
        blimps such as the DDT, where speed often makes aiming at boxes difficult. However, for most other cases, <a
          href="./incendiary.html"><b>Incendiary</b></a> is a more effective choice due to a larger area and DoT.</p>
