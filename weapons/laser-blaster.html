      <h2>Overview</h2>
      <p><b>Laser Blaster</b> is the third weapon in the AP3 and 4 upgrade trees, coming after <a
          href="./double-shooter.html">Double
          Shooter</a>. It is one of the 4 weapons in the <i>first specialisation tier</i>. It is a DPS-oriented upgrade,
        offering the best single-target damage of any T3.</p>
      <h2>Appearance</h2>
      <p>Laser Blaster has a by far the most complicated design of any tier 3 weapon. It replaces its barrel with a
        horseshoe-shaped firing chamber, with 4 heating elements/accelerators positioned inside. The sides are protected
        by multiple plates, 2 of which are hinged at the back. THese 2 plates swing backwards on weapon firing, allowing
        the 2 outermost plates on the sides to slide back, freeing space for the firing unit, which recoils as the
        accelerators move forwards, escaping the weapon entirely, before returning for the next shot.</p>
      <h2>Attack Description</h2>
      <p>Laser Blaster has the simplest attack of any T3: Single 3 damage shot. This shot deals Laser damage, which can
        damage <a href="../boxes/metal-box.html">metal boxes</a> (at 70% efficiency), allowing the player to destroy
        them. This ability is shared by <a href="./bomb-shooter.html">Bomb Shooter</a>, which damages them with its
        explosion.</p>
      <h2>Use Cases</h2>
      <p>Laser blaster does not benefit from shooting at a group of entities, and its shots can be blocked by boxes,
        causing it to get quickly overwhelmed by large numbers of them. This makes this weapon more suited to
        single-target damage, dealing 9 DPS to unresisting boxes, and 6.3 DPS to metal boxes.</p>
