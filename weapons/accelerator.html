      <h2>Overview</h2>
      <p><b>Accelerator</b> is the fourth weapon in the AP3.1 and 4.1 upgrade trees, coming after <a
          href="./laser-blaster.html">Laser Blaster</a>. It is one of the 8 weapons in the <i>second specialisation
          tier</i>. It is a firerate-oriented
        upgrade, focusing on number of shots over individual damage output.</p>
      <h2>Appearance</h2>
      <p>Accelerator appears similar to Laser Blaster (as one would expect), but with two additional diagonal
        components, holding down an extra slider on each side, each of which connects to an extra rectangular block. THe
        two original diagonal components are placed further back, revealing a gap at the corners of the vertical parts
        at the rear.</p>
      <h2>Attack Description</h2>
      <p>Accelerator possesses a special ability: Every shot it fires increases a speed multiplier, applying to the next
        shot. THis multiplier carries through shots, allowing the Accelerator to achieve very high firerates (with a
        short warm-up period). This acceleration will, however, decay if the weapon can fire but isn't, i.e. the player
        waits too long between firing successive shots.</p>
      <h2>Use Cases</h2>
      <p>Accelerator still suffers from the same problem as Laser Blaster - Shot blocking from boxes. This is slightly
        mitigated by the high DPS of full acceleration, but still reduces the effectiveness of Accelerator against
        grouped boxes.<br>The fire rate increase unfortunately also comes with a base fire rate reduction, so the
        overall effect on DPS is not great, at a maximum 3 DPS increase for 1250<i-n icon="shard"></i-n>, whilst having the same average DPS of 9, making this one of the
        least effective T4 upgrades.</p>
