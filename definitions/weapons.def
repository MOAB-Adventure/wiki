==tiny-shooter;
  title = Tiny Shooter;
  class = Weapon;
  description = Shoots a single, low damage bullet directly forwards.;
  overview = [b/Tiny Shooter] is a basic weapon, the first one unlocked in any playthrough.[br]Tiny Shooter's DPS is the lowest in the game, as is expected from the cheapest weapon. It is also the smallest weapon visually.;
  appearance = Tiny Shooter takes the appearance of a small gun. The main body of the gun is a square, with a short barrel protruding from it. 2 support pieces can also be seen on the sides.;
  attackDescription = Tiny Shooter has a simple attack pattern, firing a bullet directly in front of it, generally at the mouse cursor. This bullet travels in a straight line, until it hits a target or drops to the ground. It deals 1 [i/ballistic] damage to the first hit target. Tiny Shooter is a fairly fast-firing weapon, shooting every 20 frames (~.33s).;
  useCases = Tiny Shooter, as the first weapon, must be bought before any further upgrades.[br]Due to its very low DPS, it is not a good option for enemy destruction, therefore should be upgraded as soon as possible.;

==double-shooter;
  title = Double Shooter;
  class = Weapon;
  description = Shoots 2 bullets at once.;
  overview = [b/Double Shooter] is the second weapon in any upgrade tree, coming after [->tiny-shooter]. It is a relatively simple upgrade, adding another bullet per shot.[br]It is still a relatively basic weapon, having only one 'special mechanic'. Costing only 200[{shards}], this is the cheapest upgrade in the game.;
  appearance = Double Shooter has a similar appearance to [b/Tiny Shooter], also taking the form of a gun, but with an additional barrel, placed alongside the first, which has been shifted sideways to accommodate this.[br]Both barrels recoil at once when fired, as both bullets are fired simultaneously.;
  attackDescription = Double Shooter, as its name implies, shoots twice the number of bullets. However, it's not as simple as that, as these bullets have a 2° spread between them, which may affect accuracy when aiming at small, distant targets.;
  useCases = Double Shooter has the ability to hit 2 separate targets with its bullets, and will frequently do so at longer range, which can cause entities to be left intact for an undesirable length of time. This causes the weapon to be better suited to short-range than long-range. That being said, its substantially higher DPS makes this a viable option for saving up to buy multiple upgrades at once, or in extreme cases, a blimp upgrade.;

==bomb-shooter;
  title = Bomb Shooter;
  class = Weapon;
  description = Shoots an explosive, dealing damage in an area.;
  overview = [b/Bomb Shooter] is the third weapon in the AP1 upgrade tree, coming after [->double-shooter]. It is one of the 4 weapons in the [i/[{tlang:first specialisation tier}]]. It adds another [i/special mechanic] to the weapon, in the form of area damage. It is the most expensive tier 3 weapon.;
  appearance = Bomb Shooter has a more complicated design than its predecessors, featuring a wide barrel protruding from a larger core part. A T-shaped component is attached to the other side of the centre, opposite the barrel.[br]Two angled shielding somponents, like those found on anti-aircraft artillery, are attached to the sides.[br]The single, large barrel has a much longer recoil animation than the smaller ones of its predecessors.;
  attackDescription = Bomb Shooter does not inherit [b/Double Shooter]'s dual shot pattern, and instead shoots similarly to [->tiny-shooter], albeit with a longer attack cooldown.[br]The bullets function as artillery shells, creating a large explosion on impact with any entity. This explosion deals damage to all boxes caught in it, and can damage [->metal-box as metal boxes].;
  useCases = As most of Bomb Shooter's damage comes from its explosion, it is much better suited to dealing with groups, being able to destroy any number of [->wood-box as wooden boxes] in 2 shots.[br]Since the bullet itself deals one additional damage, it does do more damage to the first target it hits, but this is not enough to make this a viable single-target weapon. The low firerate makes its single-target DPS low, almost as low as Tiny Shooter, making it much more suited to a multi-target situation.;

==incendiary;
  title = Incendiary;
  class = Weapon;
  description = Explosions set targets on fire.;
  overview = [b/Incendiary] is the fourth weapon in the AP1.1 upgrade tree, coming after [->bomb-shooter]. 
        It is one of the 8 weapons in the [i/[{tlang:second specialisation tier}]], focusing towards damage over
        time (DoT) to a single area.;
  appearance = Incendiary takes on the appearance of Bomb Shooter, but with larger shielding parts, curving outwards at the
        back. Each part is additionally held by 2 supports instead of one, and the back portion consists of many more
        parts.;
  attackDescription = Incendiary's attack pattern is entirely unchanged from [->bomb-shooter], firing a
        single shot forwards, but has an added DoT effect for extra damage.;
  useCases = Incendiary's incredibly powerful DoT effect reduces its uselessness against single targets, increasing
        bossfight viability.[br]
        However, the DoT effect is also applied by the explosion, increasing its multi-target potential by the same
        amount: A single shot can deal [b/more than 80 damage] to [i/each hit entity], making this weapon ideal
        for clearing out large groups of metal boxes. The DoT effect also makes it a better option than [->missile-launcher] for most cases, despite having lower DPS, due to a
        reduction in aiming required.;

==missile-launcher;
  title = Missile Launcher;
  class = Weapon;
  description = Shoots faster moving slightly homing missiles.;
  overview = [b/Missile Launcher] is the fourth weapon in the AP1.2 upgrade tree, coming after [->bomb-shooter] 
          It is one of the 8 weapons in the [i/[{tlang:second specialisation
          tier}]]. It introduces homing mechanics to players.;
  appearance = Missile Launcher does away with the long barrel entirely, and the side plates curve towards the back of the
          weapon. The vertical plate on the back remains unchanged. The side plates are also further extended, on extra
          connecting poles.;
  attackDescription = Missile Launcher's shots move slightly faster, and are the first instance of homing bullets encountered in the
          game. The missiles home in on the closest box to the mouse pointer, helping the player aim. It also shoots
          slightly faster, and deals greatly increased damage, but in a smaller area than its predecessor.;
  useCases = Missile Launcher's homing ability allows the player to target boxes that would otherwise be unreachable 
          (some skill is required to pull this off, as the homing is quite weak), such
          as boxes behind others, and also helps in targeting when moving faster. This makes the weapon well-suited to use on
          blimps such as the DDT, where speed often makes aiming at boxes difficult. The high speed can also help with hitting
          fast-moving targets, which [->incendiary] might miss.;

==heavy-shots;
  title = Heavy Shots;
  class = Weapon;
  description = Large bullets deal more damage, and knock boxes back.;
  overview = [b/Heavy Shots] is the third weapon in the AP2 upgrade tree, coming after 
  [->double-shooter]. It is one of the 4 weapons in the [i/[{tlang:first specialisation
  tier}]]. It is a utility-oriented upgrade, with a more specific
  use case than other tier 3 weapons.;
  appearance = Heavy Shots has a similar appearance to [b/Tiny Shooter], but with additional bars placed under the centre
        in a star formation, and under the barrel as a support. This support also recoils with the barrel, travelling
        further and taking longer to return.;
  attackDescription = Like all T3s, the function of [b/Double Shooter] is lost, being replaced with a +1 damage increase, and a
        knockback effect. Hit boxes are moved 50px in the direction of the bullet, while a small visual explosion
        appears ath the point of impact.;
  useCases = Heavy Shots has limited use in normal gameplay, as its single-target DPS is matched or overshadowed by the
        other T3s, including [->rifle], which does it for almost half the price. It also has no
        special multi-target ability, unlike the aforementioned [b/Rifle], and [->bomb-shooter].[br]
        However, this weapon does see some use in that it is the only one to have knockback, which
        affects boxes without having to damage them: This weapon can move [->metal-box as metal boxes]
        without being able to destroy them, something unachievable with any other tier 3 weapon. This means
        Heavy Shots can move difficult boxes out of the way, allowing users to get further into the game than their
        loadout would otherwise allow.;

  class = Weapon;
  description = Hit entities collide with others.;
  overview = [b/Kinetic Impactor] is the fourth weapon in the AP2.1 upgrade tree, coming after 
          [->heavy-shots]. It is one of the 8 weapons in the [i/[{tlang:second specialisation
          tier}]]. It expands directly on the knockback utility of its predecessor, having almost identical use cases.;
  appearance = Kinetic Impactor's appearance changes significantly from Heavy Shots, with 4 of the supports extending and
        ending with square 'feet'.[br]The central part gains a three-pronged design, and an extra support holds the
        barrel.;
  attackDescription = Kinetic Impactor adds a unique ability to knock boxes into each other, with knockback propagating with 75%
        efficiency. This does not depend on knockback left, but instead resets to 75% of the [i/full amount],
        allowing a spaced chain of boxes to transfer knockback extreme distances.[br]The base knockback is also doubled,
        increasing the defensive capability of this weapon.;
  useCases = Kinetic Impactor, as an offensive weapon, is fairly useless, with the lowest damage of any T4, but has the ability to
        knock any box out of the player's hitbox with a single shot, unless blocked. This makes it effective defense
        against strong, spaced boxes, but the decreasing knockback makes it perform poorly against large groups.;

  class = Weapon;
  description = Shoots freezing ice bombs that slow down targets' weapons.;
  overview = [b/Cryo Cannon] is the fourth weapon in the AP2.2 upgrade tree, coming after 
          [->heavy-shots]. It is one of the 8 weapons in the [i/[{tlang:second specialisation
          tier}]]. Instead of expanding on knockback, this weapon instead extends its support ability to
          bosses, with ice bombs being able to slow entities down.;
  appearance = Cryo Cannon's base looks similar to that of Heavy Shots, but its barrel is supported by 
          2 new parallel bars, connected to the barrel with a vertical line. The top of the weapon also 
          possesses a large cooling fan, which rotates constantly.;
  attackDescription = Much like [->bomb-shooter], Cryo Cannon's shots now explode into a small ice cloud, applying the [i/Freezing]
          status effect to all in its radius. It does not deal much damage, but the Freezing effect reduces the target's speed, 
          maximum HP and damage resistance. This explosion does not apply knockback, but the base shot retains this ability.;
  useCases = Cryo Cannon is a support weapon, capable of effectively reducing a target's maximum HP. 
          This ability makes it perfect for use against high HP entities, such as bosses. The small AoE of the ice bomb does not 
          add much to the weapon's offensive capability, but it can help withoverlapping targets.[br]
          The damage resistance reduction of the [i/Freezing] status effect helps greatly with metal boxes, being able to 
          reduce their 100% [{dt:ballistic}] Ballistic damage reduction to 60%, allowing another weapon, for example [->sniper], to destroy them.;

# AP3/4
==laser-blaster;
  title = Laser Blaster;
  class = Weapon;
  description = Shoots pulses of high-damage plasma.;
  overview = [b/Laser Blaster] is the third weapon in the AP3 and 4 upgrade trees, coming after 
          [->double-shooter]. It is one of the 4 weapons in the [i/[{tlang:first specialisation tier}]]. It is a DPS-oriented upgrade,
        offering the best single-target damage of any T3.;
  appearance = Laser Blaster has a by far the most complicated design of any tier 3 weapon. It replaces its barrel with a
        horseshoe-shaped firing chamber, with 4 heating elements/accelerators positioned inside. The sides are protected
        by multiple plates, 2 of which are hinged at the back. These 2 plates swing backwards on weapon firing, allowing
        the 2 outermost plates on the sides to slide back, freeing space for the firing unit, which recoils as the
        accelerators move forwards, escaping the weapon entirely, before returning for the next shot.;
  attackDescription = Laser Blaster has the simplest attack of any T3: Single 3 damage shot. This shot deals Laser damage, which can
        damage [->metal-box as metal boxes] (at 70% efficiency), allowing the player to destroy
        them. This ability is shared by [->bomb-shooter], which damages them with its
        explosion, however Laser Blaster provides a more consistent damage output.;
  useCases = Laser Blaster does not benefit from shooting at a group of entities, and its shots can be blocked by boxes,
        causing it to get quickly overwhelmed by large numbers of them. This makes this weapon more suited to
        single-target damage, dealing 9 DPS to unresisting boxes, and 6.3 DPS to metal boxes.;

==accelerator;
  title = Accelerator;
  class = Weapon;
  description = Shoots faster the longer it fires for!;
  overview = [b/Accelerator] is the fourth weapon in the AP3.1 and 4.1 upgrade trees, coming after [->laser-blaster].
        It is one of the 8 weapons in the [i/[{tlang:second specialisation tier}]]. It is a firerate-oriented
        upgrade, focusing on number of shots over individual damage output.;
  appearance = Accelerator appears similar to Laser Blaster (as one would expect), but with two additional diagonal
        components, holding down an extra slider on each side, each of which connects to an extra rectangular block. THe
        two original diagonal components are placed further back, revealing a gap at the corners of the vertical parts
        at the rear.;
  attackDescription = Accelerator possesses a special ability: Every shot it fires increases a speed multiplier, applying to the next
        shot. This multiplier carries through shots, allowing the Accelerator to achieve very high firerates (with a
        short warm-up period). This acceleration will, however, decay over time if the weapon can fire but isn't doing so, e.g. the player
        waits too long between firing successive shots.;
  useCases = Accelerator still suffers from the same problem as Laser Blaster - Shot blocking from boxes. This is slightly
        mitigated by the high DPS of full acceleration, but still reduces the effectiveness of Accelerator against
        grouped boxes.[br]The fire rate increase unfortunately also comes with a base fire rate reduction, so the
        overall effect on DPS is not great, at a maximum 3 DPS increase for 1250[{shards}], whilst having the same average DPS of 9, making this one of the
        least effective T4 upgrades.;

  class = Weapon;
  description = Shoots high-damage piercing beams at a slower rate.;
  overview = [b/Lancer] is the fourth weapon in the AP3.2 and AP4.2 upgrade trees, coming after [->laser-blaster].
          It introduces a new [->shot-types as shot type] to the player, in the form of a [{st:Beam}] attack.;
  appearance = Lancer has a slightly different appearance to Laser Blaster, with a longer main body, 
          and extra spikes on the back of the weapon. These spikes rotate backwards when firing. 
          The main barrel is also reinforced, and the back end has extra material.;
  attackDescription = Lancer introduces the [{st:Beam}] shot type to players, firing a solid line of damage that 
          extends from the main barrel up to its maximum length, then shrinks horizontally until it despawns. 
          this laser does damage to any entity that hits anywhere on the line, at any time when the laser is out, even while despawning.
          It does not decrease in damage as time goes on, dealing the full amount to entities at any time.;
  useCases = The infinitely piercing beam that this weapon shoots deals very well with large crowds, especially when targtes are lined up.
          The fast extension of the laser beam allows this to hit faster targets, and the (fairly) high single-instance damage 
          makes the weapon at least viable against a single target. Laser damage deals 30% reduced damage to [->metal-box as metal boxes],
          so is less effective against them.;

# AP5
==rifle;
  title = Rifle;
  class = Weapon;
  description = Shoots a single, fast-moving bullet. Pierces one box.;
  overview = [b/Rifle] is the third weapon in the AP5 upgrade tree, coming after [->double-shooter].
        It is one of the 4 weapons in the [i/[{tlang:first specialisation tier}]], and is the cheapest tier 3
        weapon. It doesn't focus on anything in particular, improving multiple aspects of the weapon.;
  appearance = Like [b/Tiny Shooter], Rifle has a single, long barrel, in place of the dual arrangement of Double Shooter, with plates on either side
        of the weapon's main body.;
  attackDescription = Rifle reverses the change made by Double Shooter, once more firing a single bullet. However, this bullet
        functions as two, as it is able to pierce a single box, and deal an additional one damage. The combined bullet
        is visually longer, and moves much faster. This gives the weapon increased range, as the bullet will travel
        further before 'hitting the ground' (despawning).;
  useCases = Rifle is a useful upgrade, especially for how cheap it is, removing the long-range problem that [b/Double
          Shooter] had, and instead pushing towards that aspect. The increased bullet speed makes hitting smaller
        targets easier, and the equivalent damage to a single target makes this a very good long-range option.[br]The
        piercing shot allows the weapon to hit 2 boxes in one shot, but only if they are lined up. This restricts the
        multi-target capabilities, but the bullet's pierce does not slow it down, meaning it can perform longer-range
        multi-target attacks than [->bomb-shooter], whilst having the same single-target
        damage.;

==sniper;
  title = Sniper;
  class = Weapon;
  description = Shots travel to the mouse pointer instantly, dealing high damage to a single target.;
  overview = [b/Sniper] is the fourth weapon in the AP5.1 upgrade tree, coming after [->rifle]. It
        is one of the 8 weapons in the [i/[{tlang:second specialisation tier}]]. It is a fairly simple weapon, but at times
        difficult to use.;
  appearance = Sniper takes the appearance of a flattened Rifle, with a further extended barrel. The side plates now integrate
        into the sides, and flick out on firing.;
  attackDescription = Sniper dispenses with the projectile idea entirely, instead utilising an instant bolt, travelling directly to
        the mouse cursor, hitting anything there and then despawning, even if nothing was hit. This singular shot hits
        exactly one box, sorting by age of box. This means that even stacked boxes must be shot multiple times.;
  useCases = Sniper's instant precise shot requires careful aim, making larger and/or slower targets preferable to maximise
        this weapon's potential.[br]
        [b/Pausing] may be a useful mechanic to use here, as shots can be lined up while paused, 
        and they will travel instantly to the mouse pointer's position after unpausing.
        [br]Sniper, by its very nature, is a single-target weapon, and any attempt at
        multi-target use will likely be met with catastrophic failure.;

  description = Shoots 3 projectiles at once, with a large spread.;
  overview = [b/Shotgun] is the fourth weapon in the AP5.2 upgrade tree, coming after [->rifle].
        It is one of the 4 weapons in the [i/[{tlang:second specialisation tier}]].
        It focuses on multishot capability, at the cost of fire rate.;
  appearance = Shotgun looks more like [->bomb-shooter] than its predecessor, Rifle, featuring a wide barrel, bent side plates, and an extra block on the back. It also features 2 extra parts flaring out at the back of the weapon.;
  attackDescription = Shotgun shoots the same bullets as Rifle, but shoots three at once - one directly forwards, one 15° to the left and one 15° to the right. These bullets can hit multiple entities, or all hit the same one. It also has a 25% slower fire rate than Rifle.;
  useCases = Shotgun's triple shot makes it well-suited to groups of enemies, but its low base damage restricts its usability in a bossfight, and its lack of non-[{dt:ballistic}] damage renders it useless against metal boxes.;
