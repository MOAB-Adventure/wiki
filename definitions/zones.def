### ZONE DEFINITION FILE ###
==ocean-skies;
  title = Ocean Skies;
  class = World;
  overview = [b/Ocean Skies] is the first zone in MOAB Adventure. The player will spawn in here once all options have been
        chosen, and will begin playing the game.;
  appearance = Ocean Skies is a zone that takes place above an ocean with dark blue water.;
  spawning = [->wood-box as Wooden boxes], as the basic enemy of MOAB Adventure, spawn frequently
        here.[br]
        [->metal-box as Metal boxes] spawn here too, at about 1/4 of the rate.;
  strategy = The main enemy, [b/wooden boxes], are quite weak, so most strategies will work
        against them. They appear in large numbers, so it's mostly best to employ [b/multi-target weaponry], such as
        [->bomb-shooter] to clear the crowds.[br][br]As for the [b/metal boxes],
        single-target methods such as [->laser-blaster] are more effective, as the boxes are more spaced out.;
  versionHistory = Release: [i/Added];
