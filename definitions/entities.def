==wood-box;
  title = Wooden Boxes;
  class = Entity > Box;
  overview = [b/Wooden Boxes] are the most basic enemy in the game. They spawn on the right of the screen, and slowly
        move towards the left at a rate determined by the player's movement speed. They have no resistances, and have
        the lowest base health of any enemy in the game.;
  appearance = Wooden boxes take the appearance of a square wooden crate, featuring 4 planks framing a panel, with a fifth
        placed diagonally across it.;
  attacks = Wooden boxes, as a basic enemy, do not attack directly. Instead, a collision with the player is required. This
        will deal the box's health equivalent in damage, destroying whichever entity had the least health.;
  spawning = Wooden Boxes, as the basic enemy of MOAB Adventure, spawn in every zone, Ocean Skies spawning these most of all.;
  strategy = Wooden boxes are quite weak, so most strategies (short of ramming them with the blimp) will work against them.
        No specific strategy is the best, as it depends on circumstance, but they appear in such quantity that it's
        mostly best to employ [b/multi-target weaponry], such as [->bomb-shooter] to clear them out.;

==metal-box;
  title = Metal Boxes;
  class = Entity > Box;
  overview = [b/Metal Boxes] are the player's first introduction to resistances. They, like every other box, spawn on the
        right of the screen, and
        move towards the left. They have much more health than a standard [->wood-box], and
        are resistant to 2 of the 3 damage types regularly used in their spawning zones.;
  appearance = Metal boxes take the appearance of a square gray metal crate, with 2 metal cross beams, held on with visible
        bolts.;
  attacks = Metal boxes still don't directly attack, and damage on player collision.;
  spawning = Metal boxes, due to their difficulty, spawn much more rarely in [->ocean-skies] than any other zone, but become more common later in the
        game.
  strategy = Metal boxes have a lot of health, and spawn more rarely, so, (in early-game) weapons that deal high
        [b/single-target damage], including [->laser-blaster] will be
        effective against them.[br]If destroying them is not desired, or not possible, 
        [->heavy-shots] (and above) can be employed to move the boxes out of the
        way.[br][->rifle] can pierce metal boxes without damaging them, and [->sniper]
         can bypass them entirely, so the player can destroy
        other boxes behind these.;
