      <h2>Overview</h2>
      <p>The <b>MOAB</b> is the player's first character, unlocked for free at the start of the game. It has mostly average
        stats (falling short on health), and suffices for the very earliest levels in the game.</p>
      <h2>Appearance</h2>
      <p>The MOAB is a light blue blimp, with a pear-shaped body with thin stripes running down the full length of the
        blimp, and perpendicular white stripes around the nose and tail ends. The back end of the blimp has 4 light blue
        fins, but no visible means of propulsion.</p>
      <h2>Weapons</h2>
      <p>The MOAB has only one weapon slot: AP1, which can (as of v0.0.42 preview) be upgraded to tier 4.</p>
      <h2>Use Cases</h2>
      <p>As this is the blimp you spawn with, it will be used throughout most of the early-game. It can carry the player
        through the first few levels, but an upgrade is preferable for later levels as stronger boxes and harder
        bosses appear.
