      <h2>Overview</h2>
      <p><b>Bomb Shooter</b> is the third weapon in the AP1 upgrade tree, coming after <a
          href="./double-shooter.html">Double
          Shooter</a>. It is one of the 4 weapons in the <i>first specialisation tier</i>. It adds another <i>special
          mechanic</i> to the weapon, in the form of area damage. It is the most expensive tier 3 weapon.</p>
      <h2>Appearance</h2>
      <p>Bomb Shooter has a more complicated design than its predecessors, featuring a wide barrel protruding from a
        larger core part. A T-shaped component is attached to the other side of the centre, opposite the barrel.<br>Two
        angled shielding somponents, like those found on anti-aircraft artillery, are attached to the sides.<br>The
        single, large barrel has a much longer recoil animation than the smaller ones of its predecessors.</p>
      <h2>Attack Description</h2>
      <p>Bomb Shooter does not inherit <b>Double Shooter</b>'s dual shot pattern, and instead shoots similarly to <a
          href="./tiny-shooter.html">Tiny Shooter</a>, albeit with a longer attack cooldown.<br>The bullets function as
        artillery shells, creating a large explosion on impact with any entity. This explosion deals damage to all boxes
        caught in it, and can damage <a href="../boxes/metal-box.html">metal boxes</a>.</p>
      <h2>Use Cases</h2>
      <p>As most of Bomb Shooter's damage comes from its explosion, it is much better suited to dealing with groups,
        being able to destroy any number of <a href="../boxes/wood-box.html">wooden boxes</a> in 2 shots.<br>Since the
        bullet itself deals one additional damage, it does do more damage to the first target it hits, but this is not
        enough to make this a viable single-target weapon. The low firerate makes its single-target DPS low, almost as
        low as Tiny Shooter, making it much more suited to a multi-target situation.</p>
