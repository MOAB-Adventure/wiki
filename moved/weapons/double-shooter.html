      <h2>Overview</h2>
      <p><b>Double Shooter</b> is the second weapon in any upgrade tree, coming after <a href="./tiny-shooter.html">Tiny
          Shooter</a>. It is a relatively simple upgrade, adding another bullet per shot.<br>It is still a relatively
        basic weapon, having only one 'special mechanic'. Costing only 200 Shards, this is the cheapest upgrade in the game.</p>
      <h2>Appearance</h2>
      <p>Double Shooter has a similar appearance to <b>Tiny Shooter</b>, also taking the form of a gun, but with an
        additional barrel, placed alongside the first, which has been shifted sideways to accommodate this.<br>Both
        barrels recoil at once when fired, as both bullets are fired simultaneously.</p>
      <h2>Attack Description</h2>
      <p>Double Shooter, as its name implies, shoots twice the bullets. However, it's not as simple as that, as these
        bullets have a 2° spread between them, which may affect accuracy when aiming at small, distant targets.</p>
      <h2>Use Cases</h2>
      <p>Double Shooter has the ability to hit 2 separate targets with its bullets, and will frequently do so at longer
        range, which can cause entities to be left intact for an undesirable length of time. This causes the weapon to
        be better suited to short-range than long-range. That being said, its substantially higher DPS makes this a
        viable option for saving up to but multiple upgrades at once, or, in extreme cases, a blimp upgrade.</p>
