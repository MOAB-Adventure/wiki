      <h2>Overview</h2>
      <p><b>Incendiary</b> is the fourth weapon in the AP1.1 upgrade tree, coming after <a
          href="./bomb-shooter.html">Bomb
          Shooter</a>. It is one of the 8 weapons in the <i>second specialisation tier</i>, focusing towards damage over
        time (DoT) to a single area.</p>
      <h2>Appearance</h2>
      <p>Incendiary takes on the appearance of Bomb Shooter, but with larger shielding parts, curving outwards at the
        back. Each part is additionally held by 2 supports instead of one, and the back portion consists of many more
        parts.</p>
      <h2>Attack Description</h2>
      <p>Incendiary's attack pattern is entirely unchanged from <a href="./bomb-shooter.html">Bomb Shooter</a>, firing a
        single shot forwards, but has an added DoT effect for extra damage.</p>
      <h2>Use Cases</h2>
      <p>Incendiary's incredibly powerful DoT effect reduces its uselessness against single targets, increasing
        bossfight viability.<br>
        However, the DoT effect is also applied by the explosion, increasing its multi-target potential by the same
        amount: A single shot can deal <b>more than 80 damage</b> to <i>each hit entity</i>, making this weapon ideal
        for clearing out large groups of metal boxes. The DoT effect also makes it a better option than <a
          href="./missile-launcher.html">Missile Launcher</a> for most cases, despite having lower DPS, due to a
        reduction in aiming required.</p>
