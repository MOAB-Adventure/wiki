      <h2>Overview</h2>
      <p><b>Wooden Boxes</b> are the most basic enemy in the game. They spawn on the right of the screen, and slowly
        move towards the left at a rate determined by the player's movement speed. They have no resistances, and have
        the lowest base health of any enemy in the game.</p>
      <h2>Appearance</h2>
      <p>Wooden boxes take the appearance of a square wooden crate, featuring 4 planks framing a panel, with a fifth
        placed diagonally across it.</p>
      <h2>Attack Description</h2>
      <p>Wooden boxes, as a basic enemy, do not attack directly. Instead, a collision with the player is required. This
        will deal the box's health equivalent in damage, destroying whichever entity had the least health.
      </p>
      <h2>Spawning</h2>
      <p>Wooden Boxes, as the basic enemy of MOAB Adventure, spawn in every zone, Ocean Skies spawning these most of all.
      </p>
      <h2>Strategy</h2>
      <p>Wooden boxes are quite weak, so most strategies (short of ramming them with the blimp) will work against them.
        No specific strategy is the best, as it depends on circumstance, but they appear in such quantity that it's
        mostly best to employ <b>multi-target weaponry</b>, such as <a href="../weapons/bomb-shooter.html">Bomb
          Shooter</a> to clear them out.</p>
