      <h2>Overview</h2>
      <p><b>Metal Boxes</b> are the player's first introduction to resistances. They, like every other box, spawn on the
        right of the screen, and
        move towards the left. They have much more health than a standard <a href="./wood-box.html">wooden box</a>, and
        are resistant to 2 of the 3 damage types regularly used in their spawning zones.</p>
      <h2>Appearance</h2>
      <p>Metal boxes take the appearance of a square gray metal crate, with 2 metal cross beams, held on with visible
        bolts.</p>
      <h2>Attack Description</h2>
      <p>Metal boxes still don't directly attack, and damage on player collision.</p>
      <h2>Spawning</h2>
      <p>Metal boxes, due to their difficulty, spawn much more rarely in Sky High than any other zone, but become more common later in the
        game.</p>
      <h2>Strategy</h2>
      <p>Metal boxes have a lot of health, and spawn more rarely, so, (in early-game) weapons that deal high
        <b>single-target damage</b>, including <a href="../weapons/laser-blaster.html">Laser Blaster</a> will be
        effective against them.<br>If destroying them is not desired, or not possible, <a
          href="../weapons/heavy-shots.html">Heavy Shots</a> (and above) can be employed to move the boxes out of the
        way.<br><a href="../weapons/rifle.html">Rifle</a> can pierce metal boxes without damaging them, and <a
          href="../weapons/sniper.html">Sniper</a> can bypass them entirely, so the player can destroy
        other boxes behind these.
